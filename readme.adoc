= Kubernetes on AWS Workshop

This repo explains how to run and manage a Kubernetes cluster on Amazon Web Services. It also explains
how to deploy, scale and configure applications on this cluster.

Proposed agenda is to go through the described format to rampup your knowledge on Kubernetes by following
