= Create A Kubernetes Cluster Using kops
:toc:

This tutorial will walk you through how to install a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using kops.

https://github.com/kubernetes/kops[kops], short for Kubernetes Operations, is a set of tools for installing, operating, and deleting Kubernetes clusters. kops can also perform rolling upgrades from older versions of Kubernetes to newer ones. kops also manages the cluster add-ons. After the cluster is created, the link:../prereqs.adoc[Kubernetes CLI] can be used to manage resources in the cluster. If you have not gone through the link:../prereqs.adoc[Prerequisites] section, please do so now before continuing.

kops is available on Mac OSX, Linux, or the Windows 10 Linux Subsystem. 

== Install kops

There is no need to download a Kubernetes binary distribution for creating a cluster using kops. However, you do need to download the kops CLI. It takes care of downloading the right Kubernetes binary in the cloud, and then provisions and manages the cluster.

==== macOS

Install kops using brew.

    $ brew update && brew install kops

If kops is already installed, then it can be upgraded to the latest version using the following command:

    $ brew upgrade kops

==== Linux / Windows 10 Linux Subsystem

    curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4)/kops-linux-amd64
    chmod +x kops-linux-amd64
    sudo mv kops-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kops

kops is available on Mac OSX, Linux, Container image, or using with the Windows 10 Linux Subsystem. Complete installation instructions are available at https://github.com/kubernetes/kops#installing.

Latest and early versions of kops can be downloaded from https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases.

You will also need the Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) to manage the resources on the Kubernetes cluster. If you don't have the Kubernetes CLI installed, please follow the instructions link:../getting-started#download-and-install[here] to do so.

=== Create An SSH Key

kops uses a public SSH key while creating a cluster. The location of this file defaults to `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. Please generate an SSH key using `ssh-keygen` command.

    $ ssh-keygen 
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (~/.ssh/id_rsa):
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
    Enter same passphrase again: 
    Your identification has been saved in ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    Your public key has been saved in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    SHA256:bQXH2zAAcFVtpEwcOL5D1QZnXp3zkiC123456789
    The key's randomart image is:
    +---[RSA 2048]----+
    |      ..oo=B**+ +|
    |       . o+=B*=+.|
    |        +..+*O+E=|
    |       . =o=.o=oo|
    |        S.*..  o |
    |         oo      |
    |           .     |
    |                 |
    |                 |
    +----[SHA256]-----+

Alternatively, you can use the `--ssh-public-key` option to specify a custom location. 
More details about kops security can be found in the https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/security.md[documentation for kops].

== Install AWS cli

Make sure the latest version of the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html[AWS CLI]
is installed. 

   $ pip install --upgrade awscli

== IAM user permissions

The AWS user profile used in this workshop must have these http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies.html[IAM policies] attached.

    AmazonEC2FullAccess
    AmazonRoute53FullAccess
    AmazonS3FullAccess
    IAMFullAccess
    AmazonVPCFullAccess

If you are using the AWS user and credentials created as part of the link:prereqs.adoc[Prerequisites], then you should already have these permissions.

Please review these links for additional info on IAM permissions:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/aws.md#setup-iam-user. https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/iam_roles.md

== S3 Bucket for kops

kops needs a "`state store`" to store configuration information of the cluster.  For example, how many nodes in the cluster, the instance type of each node, and the Kubernetes version. The state is stored during the initial cluster creation. Any subsequent changes to the cluster are also persisted to this store. Amazon S3 is the recommended storage mechanism when running a cluster in AWS Cloud. Create an S3 bucket and pass that to the kops CLI during cluster creation.  A state store can work with multiple kops clusters.

NOTE: The bucket name must be unique otherwise you will encounter an error on deployment. We will use an example bucket name of `example-state-store-` and add a randomly generated string to the end.

    # create variables for bucket, state store, and cluster names
    $ export S3_BUCKET=example-state-store-$(cat /dev/urandom | LC_ALL=C tr -dc "[:alpha:]" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | head -c 32)
    $ export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://${S3_BUCKET}

    # use AWS CLI to create the bucket
    $ aws s3 mb $KOPS_STATE_STORE

    # enable versioning
    $ aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
      --bucket $S3_BUCKET \
      --versioning-configuration \
      Status=Enabled

== Create A Cluster

The kops CLI can be used to create a highly available cluster, with multiple master nodes spread across multiple Availability Zones. Workers can be spread across multiple zones as well. Some of the tasks that happen behind the scene during cluster creation are:

- Provisioning EC2 instances
- Creating and configuring AWS resources such as a VPC, Auto Scaling Groups, IAM users, and security groups
- Installing Kubernetes
- If required configuring Route53 DNS

When setting up a cluster you have two options on how the nodes in the cluster communicate:

. <<create-a-gossip-based-kubernetes-cluster-with-kops, Using the gossip protocol>> - kops has support for a gossip-based cluster. This does not require a domain, subdomain, or Route53 hosted zone to be registered. A gossip-based cluster is therefore easier and quicker to setup, and is the preferred method for creating a cluster for use with this workshop.
. <<appendix-create-a-dns-based-kubernetes-cluster, Using DNS>> - Creating a Kubernetes cluster that uses DNS for node discovery requires your own domain (or subdomain) and setting up Route 53 hosted zones. This allows the various Kubernetes components to use DNS resolutions find and communicate with each other, and for kubectl to be able to talk directly with the master node(s).

Instructions for creating a gossip-based cluster are provided below, however, the examples in the workshop should work with either option. Instructions for creating a DNS-based cluster are provided as an appendix at the bottom of this page.

=== Create a Gossip Based Kubernetes Cluster with kops

kops supports creating a gossip-based cluster, which uses https://github.com/weaveworks/mesh[Weave Mesh] behind the scenes. This makes the process of creating a Kubernetes cluster using kops DNS-free, and therefore much simpler. This also means a top-level domain or a subdomain is no longer required to create the cluster. To create a cluster using the gossip protocol, indicate this to by using a cluster name with a suffix of `.k8s.local`. In the following steps, we will use example.cluster.k8s.local as a sample gossip cluster name. You may choose a different name as long as it ends with `.k8s.local`.

Information on setting up a DNS-based cluster can be found at the bottom of this page in the Appendix. However, setting up a gossip-based cluster allows you to get started quickly.

We show two examples of creating gossip-based clusters below. You can choose whether to create a single-master or multi-master cluster. Workshop exercises will work on both types of cluster.

==== Default Gossip Based Cluster

By default, `create cluster` command creates a single master node and two worker nodes in the specified zones.

Create a Kubernetes cluster using the following command. This will create a cluster with a single master, multi-node and multi-az configuration:

    $ kops create cluster \
      --name example.cluster.k8s.local \
      --zones $AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES \
      --yes

You can find the command for creating the `AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES` environment variable at link:../prereqs.adoc#aws-availability-zones[].

The `create cluster` command only creates and stores the cluster config in the S3 bucket. Adding the `--yes` flag ensures that the cluster is immediately created as well.

Alternatively, you may not specify the `--yes` flag as part of the `kops create cluster` command. Then you can use `kops edit cluster example.cluster.k8s.local` command to view the current cluster state and make changes. The cluster creation, in that case, is started with the following command:

    $ kops update cluster example.cluster.k8s.local --yes

Once the `kops create cluster` command is issued, it provisions the EC2 instances, sets up Auto Scaling Groups, IAM users, Security Groups, installs Kubernetes on each node, then configures the master and worker nodes. This process can take some time based upon the number of master and worker nodes.

Note: If your 'create cluster' fails with an error like:
```
error reading s3://example-kops-state-store-workshop/workshop-prep.cluster.k8s.local/config: Unable to list AWS regions: NoCredentialProviders: no valid providers in chain
caused by: EnvAccessKeyNotFound: failed to find credentials in the environment."
```
, try setting the following environment variables before executing the 'create cluster' command:
```
export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=<your_aws_credentials_profile_name>
export AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1
```

Wait for 5-8 minutes and then the cluster can be validated as shown:

```
$ kops validate cluster
Using cluster from kubectl context: example.cluster.k8s.local

Validating cluster example.cluster.k8s.local

INSTANCE GROUPS
NAME      ROLE  MACHINETYPE MIN MAX SUBNETS
master-eu-central-1a Master  m3.medium 1 1 eu-central-1a
nodes     Node  t2.medium 2 2 eu-central-1a,eu-central-1b

NODE STATUS
NAME        ROLE  READY
ip-172-20-57-94.ec2.internal  master  True
ip-172-20-63-55.ec2.internal  node  True
ip-172-20-75-78.ec2.internal  node  True

Your cluster example.cluster.k8s.local is ready
```
==== Multi-master, multi-node, multi-az Gossip Based Cluster

Create a cluster with multi-master, multi-node and multi-az configuration. We can create and build the cluster in one step by passing the `--yes` flag.

    $ kops create cluster \
      --name example.cluster.k8s.local \
      --master-count 3 \
      --node-count 5 \
      --zones $AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES \
      --yes

A multi-master cluster can be created by using the `--master-count` option and specifying the number of master nodes. An odd value is recommended. By default, the master nodes are spread across the AZs specified using the `--zones` option. Alternatively, `--master-zones` option can be used to explicitly specify the zones for the master nodes.

The `--zones` option is also used to distribute the worker nodes. The number of workers is specified using the `--node-count` option.

As mentioned above, wait for 5-8 minutes for the cluster to be created. Validate the cluster:

```
$ kops validate cluster
Using cluster from kubectl context: example.cluster.k8s.local

Validating cluster example.cluster.k8s.local

INSTANCE GROUPS
NAME      ROLE  MACHINETYPE MIN MAX SUBNETS
master-eu-central-1a Master  m3.medium 1 1 eu-central-1a
master-eu-central-1b Master  m3.medium 1 1 eu-central-1b
master-eu-central-1c Master  c4.large  1 1 eu-central-1c
nodes     Node  t2.medium 5 5 eu-central-1a,eu-central-1b,eu-central-1c

NODE STATUS
NAME        ROLE  READY
ip-172-20-101-97.ec2.internal node  True
ip-172-20-119-53.ec2.internal node  True
ip-172-20-124-138.ec2.internal  master  True
ip-172-20-35-15.ec2.internal  master  True
ip-172-20-63-104.ec2.internal node  True
ip-172-20-69-241.ec2.internal node  True
ip-172-20-84-65.ec2.internal  node  True
ip-172-20-93-167.ec2.internal master  True

Your cluster example.cluster.k8s.local is ready
```

Note that all masters are spread across different AZs.

Your output may differ slightly from the one shown here based up on the type of cluster you created.

=== (Optional) Create a Kubernetes cluster in a private VPC

kops can create a private Kubernetes cluster, where the master and worker nodes are launched in private subnets in a VPC. This is possible with both Gossip and DNS-based clusters. This reduces the attack surface on your instances by protecting them behind security groups inside private subnets. The services hosted in the cluster can still be exposed via internet-facing ELBs if required. It's necessary to run a CNI network provider in the Kubernetes cluster when using a private topology. We have used https://www.projectcalico.org/[Calico] below, though other options such as `kopeio-vxlan`, `weave`, `romano` and others are available.

To print full list of CNI providers:

    kops create cluster --help

Create a gossip-based private cluster with master and worker nodes in private subnets:

    $ kops create cluster \
      --networking calico \
      --topology private \
      --name example.cluster.k8s.local \
      --zones $AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES \
      --yes

Once the `kops create cluster` command is issued, it provisions the EC2 instances, sets up AutoScaling Groups, IAM users, Security Groups, installs Kubernetes on each node, then configures the master and worker nodes. This process can take some time based upon the number of master and worker nodes.

Wait for 5-8 minutes and then the cluster can be validated as shown:

```
$ kops validate cluster
Using cluster from kubectl context: example.cluster.k8s.local

Validating cluster example.cluster.k8s.local

INSTANCE GROUPS
NAME                    ROLE    MACHINETYPE     MIN     MAX     SUBNETS
master-eu-central-1a    Master  m3.medium       1       1       eu-central-1a
nodes                   Node    t2.medium       2       2       eu-central-1a,eu-central-1b,eu-central-1c

NODE STATUS
NAME                                            ROLE    READY
ip-172-20-124-144.eu-central-1.compute.internal node    True
ip-172-20-58-179.eu-central-1.compute.internal  master  True
ip-172-20-93-220.eu-central-1.compute.internal  node    True

Your cluster example.cluster.k8s.local is ready
```

It is also possible to create a DNS-based cluster where the master and worker nodes are in private subnets. For more information about creating DNS-based clusters, see Appendix: Create a DNS-based Kubernetes cluster below.
If `--dns private` is also specified, a Route53 private hosted zone is created for routing the traffic for the domain within one or more VPCs. The Kubernetes API can therefore only be accessed from within the VPC. This is a current issue with kops (see https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/2032). A possible workaround is to mirror the private Route53 hosted zone with a public hosted zone that exposes only the API server ELB endpoint. This workaround is discussed http://kubecloud.io/setup-ha-k8s-kops/[here].

Although most of the exercises in this workshop should work on a cluster with a private VPC, some commands won't, specifically those that use a proxy to access internally hosted services.

== Kubernetes Cluster Context

You may create multiple Kubernetes clusters. The configuration for each cluster is stored in a configuration file, referred to as "`kubeconfig file`". By default, kubectl looks for a file named `config` in the directory `~/.kube`. The kubectl CLI uses kubeconfig file to find the information it needs to choose a cluster and communicate with the API server of a cluster.

This allows you to deploy your applications to different environments by just changing the context. For example, here is a typical flow for application development:

. Build your application using minikube (See Set up Local Development Environment for more information)
. Change the context to a test cluster created on AWS
. Use the same command to deploy to test environment
. Once satisfied, change the context again to a production cluster on AWS
. Once again, use the same command to deploy to production environment

Get a summary of available contexts:

  $ kubectl config get-contexts
  kubectl config get-contexts
  CURRENT   NAME                          CLUSTER                     AUTHINFO                    NAMESPACE
  *         example.cluster.k8s.local     example.cluster.k8s.local   example.cluster.k8s.local
            minikube                      minikube                    minikube

The output shows dfferent contexts, one per cluster, that are available to kubectl. `NAME` column shows the context name. `*` indicates the current context.

View the current context:

  $ kubectl config current-context
  example.cluster.k8s.local

If multiple clusters exist, then you can change the context:

  $ kubectl config use-context <config-name>

== Turn on an API version for your Cluster

Note: This section is for Kubebernetes 1.7.x, in 1.8.x the api is `batch/v1beta1`. 

Kubernetes resources are created with a specific API version. The exact value is defined by the `apiVersion` attribute in the resource configuration file. Some of the values are `v1`, `extensions/v1beta1` or `batch/v1`. By default, resources with `apiVersion` values X, Y, Z are enabled. If a resource has a version with the word `alpha` in it, then that version needs to be explicitly enabled in the cluster. For example, if you are running a Kubernetes cluster of version 1.7.x, then Cron Job resource cannot be created unless `batch/v2alpha1` is explicitly enabled.

This section shows how to turn on an API version for your cluster. It will use `batch/v2alpha1` as an example.

Specific API versions can be turned on or off by passing `--runtime-config=api/<version>` flag while bringing up the API server. To turn on our specific version, we'll need to pass `--runtime-config=batch/v2alpha1=true`.

For a cluster created using kops, this can be done by editing the cluster configuration using the command shown:

    $ kops edit cluster --name example.cluster.k8s.local

This will open up the cluster configuration in a text editor. Update the `spec` attribute such that it looks like as shown:

    spec:
      kubeAPIServer:
        runtimeConfig:
          batch/v2alpha1: "true"
      api:

Save the changes and exit the editor. Kubernetes cluster needs to re-read the configuration. This can be done by forcing a rolling update of the cluster using the following command:

NOTE: This process can easily take 30-45 minutes. Its recommended to leave the cluster without any updates during that time.

  $ kops rolling-update cluster --yes
  Using cluster from kubectl context: example.cluster.k8s.local

  NAME                    STATUS  NEEDUPDATE      READY   MIN     MAX     NODES
  master-eu-central-1a    Ready   0               1       1       1       1

  I1025 20:59:53.325980     354 rollingupdate.go:174] Rolling update completed!

This command will first stop one master node in the cluster, re-read the configuration information and start that master. Then it will do the same for rest of the master nodes. And then it will repeat that for each worker node in the cluster. After all the server and worker nodes have been restarted, the rolling update of the cluster is complete.

Let's verify that the attributes are now successfully passed to the API server. Get the list of pods for the API server using the command shown:

  $ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-apiserver
  kube-system   kube-apiserver-ip-172-20-117-32.ec2.internal            1/1       Running   0          7m
  kube-system   kube-apiserver-ip-172-20-62-108.ec2.internal            1/1       Running   6          16m
  kube-system   kube-apiserver-ip-172-20-79-64.ec2.internal             1/1       Running   2          12m

The output shows three pods, one each for API server, corresponding to the three master nodes. This output is from a cluster with three master nodes. The output may be different if your cluster was created with different number of masters.

Search for the `--runtime-config` option as shown:

  $ kubectl describe --namespace=kube-system pod <pod-name> | grep runtime

`<pod-name>` is name of one of the pods shown above.

A formatted output is shown below:

  /usr/local/bin/kube-apiserver \
    --address=127.0.0.1 \
    --admission-control=NamespaceLifecycle,LimitRanger,ServiceAccount,PersistentVolumeLabel,DefaultStorageClass,DefaultTolerationSeconds,ResourceQuota \
    --allow-privileged=true \
    --anonymous-auth=false \
    --apiserver-count=3 \
    --authorization-mode=AlwaysAllow \
    --basic-auth-file=/srv/kubernetes/basic_auth.csv \
    --client-ca-file=/srv/kubernetes/ca.crt \
    --cloud-provider=aws \
    --etcd-servers-overrides=/events#http://127.0.0.1:4002 \
    --etcd-servers=http://127.0.0.1:4001 --insecure-port=8080 --kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP,Hostname,ExternalIP \
    --runtime-config=batch/v2alpha1=true \
    --secure-port=443 \
    --service-cluster-ip-range=100.64.0.0/13 \
    --storage-backend=etcd2 \
    --tls-cert-file=/srv/kubernetes/server.cert \
    --tls-private-key-file=/srv/kubernetes/server.key \
    --token-auth-file=/srv/kubernetes/known_tokens.csv \
    --v=2 \
    1>>/var/log/kube-apiserver.log 2>&1

The output clearly shows that `--runtime-config=batch/v2alpha1=true` is passed as an option to the API server. This means the cluster is now ready for creating creating APIs with version `batch/v2alpha1`.

== Instance Groups with kops

An instance group, or ig for short, is a kops concept that defines a grouping of similar nodes. In AWS, an instance group maps to an Auto Scaling Group (ASG). Instructions on how to create instance groups can be found link:instance-groups/readme.adoc[here].

== Delete A Cluster

Any cluster can be deleted as shown:

    $ kops delete cluster \
      <cluster-name> \
      --yes

`<cluster-name>` is the name of the cluster. For example, our `example.cluster.k8s.local` cluster can be deleted as:

    $ kops delete cluster \
      example.cluster.k8s.local \
      --yes

If you leave off the `--yes` flag, you will get a listing of all the resources kops will delete.  To confirm deletion, run the command again appending `--yes`.

If you created a private VPC, then an additional cleanup of resources is required as shown below:

    # Find Route53 hosted zone ID from the console or via CLI and delete hosted zone
    aws route53 delete-hosted-zone --id $ZONEID
    # Delete VPC if you created earlier
    $ aws ec2 detach-internet-gateway --internet $IGW --vpc $VPCID
    aws ec2 delete-internet-gateway --internet-gateway-id $IGW
    aws ec2 delete-vpc --vpc-id $VPCID

To remove the state store S3 bucket:

    aws s3 rb $KOPS_STATE_STORE

== Appendix: Create a DNS-based Kubernetes cluster

To create a DNS-based Kubernetes cluster you'll need a top-level domain or subdomain that meets one of the following scenarios:

. Domain purchased/hosted via AWS
. A subdomain under a domain purchased/hosted via AWS
. Setting up Route53 for a domain purchased with another registrar, transfering the domain to Route53
. Subdomain for clusters in Route53, leaving the domain at another registrar

Then you need to follow the instructions in https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/aws.md#configure-dns[configure DNS]. Typically, the first and the last bullets are common scenarios.

==== Default DNS-based cluster

By default, `create cluster` command creates a single master node and two worker nodes in the specified zones.

Create a Kubernetes cluster using the following command. For the purposes of this demonstration, we will use a cluster name of example.cluster.com as our registered DNS. This will create a cluster with a single master, multi-node and multi-az configuration:

    $ kops create cluster \
      --name example.cluster.com \
      --zones $AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES \
      --yes

The `create cluster` command only creates and stores the cluster config in the S3 bucket. Adding `--yes` option ensures that the cluster is immediately created as well.

Alternatively, you may leave off the `--yes` option from the `kops create cluster` command. This will allow you to use `kops edit cluster example.cluster.com` command to view the current cluster state and make changes before actually creating the cluster. 

The cluster creation, in that case, is started with the following command:

    $ kops update cluster example.cluster.com --yes

Once the `kops create cluster` or `kops update cluster` command is issued with the `--yes` flag,, it provisions the EC2 instances, setup Auto Scaling Groups, IAM users, security groups, and install Kubernetes on each node, configures master and worker nodes. This process can take a few minutes based upon the number of master and worker nodes.

Wait for 5-8 minutes and then the cluster can be validated as shown:

```
$ kops validate cluster --name=example.cluster.com
Validating cluster example.cluster.com

Verify the client and server version:

  $ kubectl version
  Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"8", GitVersion:"v1.8.1", GitCommit:"f38e43b221d08850172a9a4ea785a86a3ffa3b3a", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2017-10-12T00:45:05Z", GoVersion:"go1.9.1", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"darwin/amd64"}
  Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"7", GitVersion:"v1.7.4", GitCommit:"793658f2d7ca7f064d2bdf606519f9fe1229c381", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2017-08-17T08:30:51Z", GoVersion:"go1.8.3", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

It shows that Kubectl CLI version is 1.8.1 and the server version is 1.7.4. Cluster version may changed depending on kops version.

==== Multi-master, multi-node, multi-az DNS-based cluster

Check the list of Availability Zones that exist for your region using the following command:

    $ aws --region <region> ec2 describe-availability-zones

Create a cluster with multi-master, multi-node and multi-az configuration. We can create and build the cluster in
one step by passing the `--yes` flag.

    $ kops create cluster \
      --name example.cluster.com \
      --master-count 3 \
      --node-count 5 \
      --zones $AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES \
      --yes

A multi-master cluster can be created by using the `--master-count` option and specifying the number of master nodes. An odd value is recommended. By default, the master nodes are spread across the AZs specified using the `--zones` option. Alternatively, `--master-zones` option can be used to explicitly specify the zones for the master nodes.

`--zones` option is also used to distribute the worker nodes. The number of workers is specified using the `--node-count` option.

As mentioned above, wait for 5-8 minutes for the cluster to be created. Validate the cluster:

```
$ kops validate cluster --name=example.cluster.com
