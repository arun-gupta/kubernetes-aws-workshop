= Deployments

== Creating a Deployment
The folowing will be an example Deployment with an nginx base image. Let's begin with the template:

	apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
	kind: Deployment # kubernetes object type
	metadata:
	  name: nginx-deployment # deployment name
	spec:
	  replicas: 3 # number of replicas
	  template:
	    metadata:
	      labels:
	        app: nginx # pod labels
	    spec:
	      containers:
	      - name: nginx # container name
	        image: nginx:1.12.1 # nginx image
	        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent # if exists, will not pull new image
	        ports: # container and host port assignments
	        - containerPort: 80
	          hostPort: 80
	        - containerPort: 443
	          hostPort: 443          

Run the following command to create Deployment:

	kubectl create -f https://github.com/CloudyMind/kubernetes-aws-workshop/blob/master/templates/deployment.yaml --record

The *--record* flag will track changes made through each revision.

To monitor deployment rollout status:

	kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment

To obtain state of the deployment:

	kubectl get deployments

== Updating a Deployment
You can update the Deployment by making edits to the spec template. In this example, let's change to the latest nginx image.

First, type the following to open up the text editor:

	kubectl edit deployment/nginx-deployment

Next, change the image from *nginx:1.12.1* to *nginx:latest*.

This should perform a rolling update of the deployment. To track the deployment details such as revision, image version, and ports - type in the following:

	kubectl describe deployments

The output should look similar the following:

	$ kubectl describe deployments

== Rolling back a Deployment
To rollback to a previous version, first check the revision history:

	kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment

If you only want to rollback to the previous revision, enter the following command:

	kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment

If rolling back to a specific revision then enter:

	kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment --to-revision=1

== Delete a deployment
Run the following command to delete deployment:

	kubectl delete -f https://github.com/CloudyMind/kubernetes-aws-workshop/blob/master/templates/deployment.yaml
